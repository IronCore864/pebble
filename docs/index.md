# Pebble

_Take control of your internal daemons!_

**Pebble** helps you to orchestrate a set of local service processes as an organized set. It resembles well known tools such as _supervisord_, _runit_, or _s6_, in that it can easily manage non-system processes independently from the system services, but it was designed with unique features that help with more specific use cases.
